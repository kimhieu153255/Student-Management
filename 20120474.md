- This is a simple student management system that allows you to add, edit, delete and find students. It also allows you to add, edit, delete and find courses. You can also add students to courses, remove students from courses, find students in courses and find scores of students in courses.
- It includes 4 main features: Student, Course, Courses of Student and Score Board. Each feature I will describe in detail below.

## I. How to run

1. Clone this project to your computer.
2. Run **`databaseInit.sql`** in your Oracle database (Here I use Oracle 21c). I will change the password of User **`System`** to **`153255`**, so you have problems with this password of User **`System`** in different projects.
3. Setup **`Tomcat 10.1.7`** server before running the project.

4. Open the project in **`Eclipse`** and run project with this server.
